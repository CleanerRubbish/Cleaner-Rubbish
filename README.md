# Compiler Principle
##  Basic Data Type
1. int  23 represents 23 in decimal 23B represents 23 in binary 23H represents 23 in Hex 
2. float
3. string
4. bool
5. null

## Note
$ means note   &nbsp;   "$" this is our note equals // in c or # in python

## Compound Type
1. list => list means array , it acts like python list 
1. map => is a key value pair
1. tuple => also likes array but is immutable
1. mat => represent matrix  which can do something like numpy in python

## Control Statement
1. if {... } elif{ ...} else{....}
1. switch (){ case(): ....; break}
1. while(){....}
1. for(i in range(x))
1. break continue which can break out of the loop statement or jump into the beginning of the loop to avoid going deep respectively
1. struct Name{} =>  use "struct" to define your own data type 

## Function
def(x,y){return xx}
## Additional
### Input and Output
x = input();
print("%s%d%c",);
### Module
import xxx;
### Equal
x = y return bool 
### Lambda
f = lambda (x){x*x};
### 
try .... catch
